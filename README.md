# Predicting Hazardous Near Earth Objects
**Collaborators: Eshaan Arora, Jose Currea, Gayathree Gopi, Aileen Li, Felipe Zapater**

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) pose a potential threat to our planet, making their early detection critical for risk assessment and mitigation. 
In this project, we analyzed a NASA dataset containing over 338,000 observations of asteroids to predict whether an NEO is hazardous. 
We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features influencing an asteroid’s risk level, including size, velocity, and brightness. 
Using machine learning models such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, we evaluated classification performance, ultimately achieving 91% accuracy with Random Forest. 
This project highlights the power of data science in space safety, contributing to the ongoing efforts to monitor and respond to potential asteroid threats.
